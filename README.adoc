= Software Architecture Documentation Example with arc42 and C4 Model

This example shows how to use https://arc42.org/[arc42] in combination with the https://c4model.com/[C4 model] with the Documentation as Code technique.

It shows how to use the techniques described in https://www.workingsoftware.dev/software-architecture-documentation-the-ultimate-guide/[The ultimate Guide to Software Architecture Documentation].

Check out the deployed https://bitsmuggler.github.io/arc42-c4-software-architecture-documentation-example/[HTML build] provided on GitHub Pages.

Technologies involved:

* https://arc42.org/[arc42] to get the structure for the software architecture documentation
* https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how software architects and developers think about and build software.
* https://structurizr.com/dsl[Structurizr DSL] to describe the https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] of the software system
* https://github.com/structurizr/cli[Structurizr CLI] a command line utility for Structurizr to export the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL
* https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] as format to write the software architecture documentation
* https://doctoolchain.org[docToolchain] to generate the representations of the software architecture documentation written in https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. docToolchain makes use of  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor].
* https://kroki.io[Kroki] to generate diagrams
* https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools] to generate and manage Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

== Prerequisites

=== Generate PlantUML Diagrams from the C4 Model

==== With the Structurizr CLI via Docker Image

[source, bash]
----
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/cli export -w documentation/bank.dsl -format plantuml/structurizr -output documentation/diagrams
----

==== With a local installed Structurizr CLI

Download the https://github.com/structurizr/cli/releases[structurizr-cli], unzip and move it into `./bin/structurizr-cli` or use the latest Docker Image

[source, bash]
----
curl --show-error --location https://github.com/structurizr/cli/releases/download/v{selected-version}/structurizr-cli-{selected-version}.zip  -o tmp.zip && unzip -d bin/structurizr-cli/. tmp.zip && rm tmp.zip
----

Generate the diagrams from the structurizr workspace model

[source, bash]
----
./bin/structurizr-cli/structurizr.sh export -w documentation/bank.dsl -format plantuml/structurizr -output documentation/diagrams
----

==== With the docToolchain

https://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/[docToolchain] uses the Structurizr CLI to generate the PlantUML diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL.

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw exportStructurizr
----

== Migrate markdown based ADRs from adr-tools to AsciiDoc

=== Install and configure adr-tools

. Install https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools]
. Configure the adr template with the following header config

[source, bash]
----
adr config
----

Replace the content of the `template.md` file with the following content:

[source, markdown]
----
### TITLE

Date: DATE

#### Status

STATUS

#### Context

The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision.

#### Decision

The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

#### Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
----

=== Migrate the generated markdown based decisions with the docker-asciidoctor image under Linux

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw exportMarkdown && cp ./build/adrs/*.adoc ./documentation/adrs/
----

== Generate the software architecture documentation representations

NOTE: these examples use the public https://kroki.io[kroki.io] instance to generate the diagrams.
For your own documentation, replace the references to kroki.io with your own kroki instance.

Generate the documentation as HTML representation

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateHTML
----

Generate the documentation as PDF representation

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generatePDF
----

Generate the documentation as Microsite

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateSite
----
